# CellularAutomata

A cellular automata simulator built in python with pygame, allowing custom rules and frame-by-frame simulation 

The general principle is that Conway's Game of Life is an interesting collection of simple rules that creates complex behavior, so with more rules the behavior should be even cooler. Right? While this could be true in some instances, the interface is clunky and needs some work...
